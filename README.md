# 🌐 Beginner Website Project Plan

Having fun and learn how to build a landing page / one-pager and pass the assignment.

- **GitHub** → to store and share the website code
- **VS Code** → code editor
- **Browser** → test the website
- **Moodboard** → Dribbble/Behance/Mobb/Pinterest

---

## 👩‍👩‍👧 Collaboration

- Share Figma file link for quick feedback https://www.figma.com/design/0S3IjsG0xrQO3QLyY0qu97/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=u7ximMXjPgM1BnCN-1
- Use comments in Figma to discuss design ideas
- Keep a **moodboard page** in Figma with:

  - Example websites for inspiration

---

## 🧩 Roles

- **Developer** → Mob: Together - Builds HTML files, tests in browser
- **Content Writer** → Together – Prepares text (About, Welcome, Links, etc.)
- **Project Lead** → Together – Keeps track of plan, deadlines, and shares updates

_(In a solo project, you just “wear all the hats” yourself 👒)_

## 📂 Website Structure

- `index.html` (Home / About us)
- `style.css` (Styling)
- `main.js` (Functionality)
- `images/` (Profile picture, assets)

## ✅ Steps

1. Gather inspiration → make a moodboard in Figma
2. Draft a wireframe (layout) → Figma
3. Write short text content → In maybe content.md
4. Generate images and assets with AI (comic strip)
5. Build `index.html` → add heading, text, image, link
